Star Wars: Attack of the DOM. A cool little demonstration of HTML5, CSS3, and JS combined to make lightsabers attack your webpages! Star Wars javascript physics.

This project is a fork of our [Pure CSS3 Stars Wars Lightsaber Checkboxes](https://github.com/scotch-io/Pure-CSS3-Star-Wars-Lightsaber-Checkboxes). We decided to expand on it for fun. Like the other project, this probably won't be useful in a real world setting or project, but it's still a pretty cool demo.

## About
This project is broken down into a few parts actually. There are:

 - Simple Demos on [CodePen.io](http://codepen.io/ncerminara).
 - [Full Demo](http://scotch.io/demos/star-wars-attack-of-the-dom) on scotch.io. This includes:
    - Star Wars Intro Text
    - Star Wars Scrolling Text
    - A never ending battle against an infinite loop of DOM element creation
 - [Fight your webpage](http://scotch.io/apps/star-wars-attack-of-the-dom) functionality. This is:
    - Slow and buggy
    - Works best on small sites
    - Large DOM and JS intensive sites will not play nice with this
    - Will make your computer's fan dance

## Tools Used
Star Wars: Attack of the DOM uses a JavaScipt port of a popular 2D physics engine called Box2d. (This guy)[https://github.com/franzenzenhofer/box2d-jquery] made a really neat jQuery wrapper of it, too. It's definitely missing some features and has it's bugs, but is, nevertheless, an extremely simple and awesome wrapper for getting quick physics on your webpage. We also use our [Pure CSS3 Stars Wars Lightsaber Checkboxes](https://github.com/scotch-io/Pure-CSS3-Star-Wars-Lightsaber-Checkboxes) for the swords.
